FUCK MY LI -
ok no. we're not. doing that. we're gonna fix this. (it's 5am btw)
I'm not. the biggest fan of myself right now. my fuckass college has destroyed my self-esteem and killed any love I ever had for coding BUT.
we need to get a job. and hey, I may have never completed a project in my life but at least it's honest work. fuck AI.
I hate my college with a passion and could never properly finish a project because of the impossible deadlines but hey.
I got a lot of work done.
and lowkey most of these are like. 75% complete.
I just need to chug some coffee and inspiral and rawdog my duel with god.
did my past self make it as difficult as possible for myself?
well.
let's go over a list of offences shall we.
this bitch:
never wrote comments.
didn't bother to write readmes like, 85% of the time. unless the assignment specifically required it. and evem then usually just wrote 2 lines of incomprehensible bs for mariyadai.
didn't maintain a github or my projects in one place anywhere.
i had to like. scour them from all weird corners of the internet
like fucking onlinegdb. and my college google drive. and the long time ago section of my downloads folder. and my partner's linkedin.
AND HALF THE CODE IS WRONG.
ragequit all my google classrooms after the course so i cant even retrieve the code from there.
will have 586759 in progress identically labelled copies of every project
like babe. i get that youre depressed and hate everything but konjo please
and like. i didnt even apply to google cause i was too fucked to make a proper resume trying to finish angry birds?? FUMBLING WORSE THAN RAFAELA I SWEAR      
just
whatever, I guess we;re doing this now.
